# Rule

A rule-change is adopted if and only if the vote is at least two-thirds in the affirmative (`+1`) among eligible voters.

```javascript
let v = number of votes
let a = number of affirmative votes

let p = a / v

if p >= (2/3), proposal is adopted
```

## Original Language

>A rule-change is adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters. If this rule is not amended by the end of the second complete circuit of turns, it automatically changes to require only a simple majority.
