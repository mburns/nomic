# Rule

The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered from achieving `N` points to any other state of affairs.

The magnitude of `N` and the means of earning points may be changed, and rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.
