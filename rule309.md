# Rule

Every player is an eligible voter.

Eligible voters may choose to participate in votes on rule-changes or abstain. If no action is taken, a voter is considered to have abstained and is neither for or against the proposal.

Quorum is half of all active registered players. Votes on rule-changes take effect if and only if quorum is reached.

```javascript
let n = number of active players
let v = number of votes
let q = Floor(n / 2) + 1

if v >= q, quorum is reached.
```

## Original Language

>Rule 105
>Every player is an eligible voter. Every eligible voter must participate in every vote on rule-changes.
