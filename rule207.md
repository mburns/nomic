# Rule

Each player always has exactly one vote. They can change their vote on a proposal as many times as they would like. When quorum is reached, the Player's most recent vote will be counted.

Upon submission of a rule-change, the proposing Player automatically casts an immutable +1 vote for their proposal.

## Original Language
