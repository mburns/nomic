## Relevant Rules

> [Rule 201](https://github.com/mburns/nomic/blob/master/rule201.md): All players begin with zero points. In mail and computer games, players shall alternate in *alphabetical order* by surname.

> [Rule 202](https://github.com/mburns/nomic/blob/master/rule202.md): In mail and computer games, instead of throwing a die, players subtract 291 from the ordinal number of their proposal and multiply the result by the fraction of favorable votes it received, rounded to the nearest integer. (This yields a number between 0 and 10 for the first player, with the upper limit increasing by one each turn; more points are awarded for more popular proposals.)

> [Rule 204](https://github.com/mburns/nomic/blob/master/rule204.md): If and when rule-changes can be adopted without unanimity, the players who vote against winning proposals shall receive 10 points each.

> [Rule 206](https://github.com/mburns/nomic/blob/master/rule206.md): When a proposed rule-change is defeated, the player who proposed it loses 10 points.

> [Rule 208](https://github.com/mburns/nomic/blob/master/rule208.md): In mail and computer games, the winner is the first player to achieve 200 (positive) points.
