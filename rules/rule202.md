# Rule

One turn consists of two parts in this order:

1. Proposing one rule-change and having it voted on, and
2. Subtracting `291` from the ordinal number of their proposal and multiply the result by the fraction of favorable votes it received, rounded to the nearest integer.

    (This yields a number between `0` and `10` for the first player, with the upper limit increasing by one each turn; more points are awarded for more popular proposals.)

## Original Language

>One turn consists of two parts in this order: (1) proposing one rule-change and having it voted on, and (2) throwing one die once and adding the number of points on its face to one's score.
>
>In mail and computer games, instead of throwing a die, players subtract `291` from the ordinal number of their proposal and multiply the result by the fraction of favorable votes it received, rounded to the nearest integer. (This yields a number between `0` and `10` for the first player, with the upper limit increasing by one each turn; more points are awarded for more popular proposals.)
