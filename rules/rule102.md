# Rule

Initially rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the 200's are mutable.

Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.
