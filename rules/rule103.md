# Rule

A rule-change is any of the following:

1. the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule;
2. the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an amendment of a mutable rule; or
3. the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule or vice versa.

(Note: This definition implies that, at least initially, all new rules are mutable; immutable rules, as long as they are immutable, may not be amended or repealed; mutable rules, as long as they are mutable, may be amended or repealed; any rule of any status may be transmuted; no rule is absolutely immune to change.)
